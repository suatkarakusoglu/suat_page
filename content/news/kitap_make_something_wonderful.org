* Content
12 years have passed since Steve Jobs passed away :/.

I believe you will enjoy reading this book, which collects his conversations, correspondence, and memoirs, as if it were written in his own words, and is freely available.

Some topics covered in the book are:

- His departure from Apple, the founding of NeXT, and his return to Apple after NeXT was acquired.
- His successes at Pixar.
- His integration of technology, art, and user experience, as well as insights into his approach to education.
